## Overview

⚠️ **FREE SNAPSHOT SERVICE BY FASTNEAR WILL BE DEPRECATGED STARTING JUNE 1ST, 2025. We strongly recommend all node operators to use [Epoch Sync](../intro/epoch_sync.md) when possible.**

Before you start running a node, you must first sync with the network. This means your node needs to download all the headers and blocks that other nodes in the network already have. You can speed up this process by downloading the latest data snapshots from a public cloudfront endpoint.

The latest daily snapshots are made available to the public by FastNear, and can be used to set up a validator node or RPC. 

For detailed instructions, please refer to [HERE](https://docs.fastnear.com/docs/snapshots).
